Awesome — let’s build the **DRL Portfolio Optimization + On-Chain Settlement** project end-to-end, mapped to your 12-stage lifecycle and tuned for hedge-fund rigor. Below is a concrete, *ship-ready* blueprint: architecture, repo layout, CI/CD, infra, data, modeling, monitoring, security, and KPIs — plus minimal code/config stubs so you can stand it up immediately.

# 1) System Overview (what you’re building)

* **Goal**: A production MLOps stack that trains a **Deep RL** policy to allocate across assets, **uses Neo4j** to encode cross-asset relationships and constraints, **backtests/live-papers** the strategy, and **executes via smart contract** on an Ethereum testnet.
* **Value for HF/VC/IB**: Shows systematic alpha R\&D, robust controls (risk & compliance), real deployment muscle (K8s/ArgoCD), and auditability (MLflow + on-chain settlement).

# 2) High-Level Architecture

* **Data**: Market data (prices, volumes), fundamentals, macro; **Neo4j** stores the *asset relationship knowledge graph* (sectors, supply chain, factor clusters, correlation regimes, liquidity buckets).
* **Feature/Env**: RL environment wraps a portfolio simulator with transaction costs, slippage, borrow costs, risk constraints (e.g., sector/asset caps), and **graph features** (node2vec/GraphSAGE embeddings) from Neo4j.
* **Training**: PPO (or SAC) with population-based tuning. **MLflow** tracks params/metrics/artifacts.
* **Serving**: **FastAPI** service exposes `get_weights(state)`; packaged in Docker; deployed to **Kubernetes** via **ArgoCD**.
* **Orchestration**: **Airflow** (data > features > train > validate > register > deploy > backtest > report).
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana (infra), **Evidently** (data/model drift), custom risk dashboards (PnL/Sharpe/DD).
* **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contract (Sepolia) holding virtual portfolio ledger & trade settlement; strategy signs orders → relayer/microservice submits tx → on-chain event confirms execution; hashes of model artifacts stored for auditability.

# 3) Repository Structure (mono-repo)

# 4) Neo4j Knowledge Graph (alpha + constraints)

**Purpose**

* Encode structure: sectors, microstructure, factor clusters, ETF membership, liquidity tiers.
* **Use in RL**: Fetch neighborhood context as features; **graph embeddings** improve state representation; enforce *pathwise constraints* (e.g., exposure to highly connected risk hubs).

**Minimal schema (`graphs/schema.cql`)**

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT asset_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (a:Asset) REQUIRE a.ticker IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT sec_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (s:Sector) REQUIRE s.name IS UNIQUE;

MERGE (AAPL:Asset {ticker:'AAPL', liquidity:'high', region:'US'})
MERGE (TECH:Sector {name:'Technology'})
MERGE (AAPL)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(TECH);

// Correlation / supply-chain / factor edges (weights, recency)
MATCH (a:Asset {ticker:'AAPL'}), (b:Asset {ticker:'MSFT'})
MERGE (a)-[r:CORRELATED {rho:0.75, window:'60d'}]->(b);
```

**Embeddings job (node2vec)**

* Batch job writes `asset_id → embedding[128]` into Neo4j or your feature store.
* Features pulled per episode via parameterized Cypher in the environment.

# 5) RL Environment (finance-grade)

**Key mechanics**

* **Action space**: target weights per asset (softmaxed; optional cash bucket).
* **Reward**: risk-adjusted (daily portfolio return minus λ·risk\_penalty). Include:

  * Transaction costs & slippage
  * Volatility penalty, turnover penalty
  * Drawdown penalty (CVaR/ES constraint via Lagrangian)
* **Constraints**: sector caps, single-name caps, liquidity buckets, leverage, net/gross exposure.

**Pseudocode (simplified)**

```python
obs = concat(
  price_features, factor_signals, graph_embedding(asset), risk_state
)
action = policy(obs)               # weights
trade = target_to_trades(action, prev_weights, tcosts)
pnl, risk = simulate(trade, slippage, borrow, fees)
reward = pnl - lam_vol*vol - lam_dd*dd - lam_turnover*turnover
state = next_state()
```

**Algorithms**

* Start with **PPO**; later add **SAC** for continuous actions.
* **Population Based Training (PBT)** to tune entropy, clip range, λ’s.
* Curriculum: start with low-vol universes → expand assets/constraints.

# 6) Data Strategy

* **Sources**: end-of-day OHLCV, intraday (optional), fundamentals (TTM), macro series.
* **Versioning**: **DVC** remote (S3/GCS). *Never* commit raw data to git.
* **Feature pipelines**: dvc stages → parquet features; outputs stamped with run hash.

`dvc.yaml` (sketch)

```yaml
stages:
  ingest:
    cmd: python airflow/tasks/ingest.py
    deps: [airflow/tasks/ingest.py]
    outs: [data/raw]
  features:
    cmd: python airflow/tasks/features.py
    deps: [data/raw, graphs/embeddings/embedding.parquet]
    outs: [data/features]
```

# 7) Training & Validation

* **Train**: `model/training/train_ppo.py` logs to **MLflow** (metrics, artifacts, policy snapshots).
* **Validation gates** (block deployment if failing):

  * Out-of-sample Sharpe ≥ target (e.g., **≥ 1.0** on 2y OOS)
  * Max Drawdown ≤ threshold (e.g., **≤ 15%**)
  * Turnover ≤ limit (e.g., **≤ 250%/yr**)
  * Stress tests: 2008/2020/2022 style regimes, liquidity stress
  * **Backtest reproducibility** hash matches

# 8) Serving (FastAPI) + Executor (On-Chain)

**FastAPI** (`services/api/main.py`)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import mlflow
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/drl-portfolio/Production")

@app.post("/weights")
def get_weights(payload: dict):
    state = np.array(payload["state"], dtype=float)
    w = model.predict(state).tolist()
    return {"weights": w, "timestamp": payload["timestamp"]}
```

**Executor microservice**

* Receives weights → computes delta trades → signs order with private key → submits to chain via JSON-RPC.
* Writes tx hash + event logs to Postgres and **stores model artifact hash** on-chain for audit.

# 9) Smart Contract (Solidity sketch)

* **Responsibilities**: hold portfolio state, accept signed orders, apply risk checks (caps), emit events.

`contracts/Portfolio.sol` (outline)

```solidity
contract Portfolio {
  address public strategist;
  mapping(bytes32 => int256) public weights; // tickerHash -> bps
  event Rebalance(bytes32 indexed asset, int256 bps, bytes32 modelHash);

  function setStrategist(address s) external onlyOwner { strategist = s; }
  function rebalance(bytes32[] calldata assets, int256[] calldata bps, bytes32 modelHash) external {
    require(msg.sender == strategist, "unauthorized");
    // sanity checks, caps, sum to 10_000 bps
    for (...) { weights[assets[i]] = bps[i]; emit Rebalance(assets[i], bps[i], modelHash); }
  }
}
```

* Deploy to **Sepolia**; keep ABI + addresses versioned; use **Hardhat** for tests & CI.

# 10) CI/CD (automation you’ll demo in the interview)

**CI (GitHub Actions)**

* Triggers on PR:

  * Lint/format (ruff/black), mypy, unit tests, **contract tests**
  * Build Docker images (api/executor)
  * **Data contract tests** on sample batch (schema, nulls, range)
  * Spin ephemeral environment (Kind) → integration tests (API ↔ Neo4j ↔ MLflow ↔ contract)
* **Model CI**:

  * Run *fast* training smoke (few episodes)
  * If passed + label `run-full-train`, launch **Airflow** or **self-hosted runner** for full train; log to MLflow.

**CD**

* On model registration to `Production` in MLflow → push tag → ArgoCD sync:

  * Update K8s Deployment (FastAPI)
  * Run post-deploy checks (readiness, shadow traffic)
  * Canary 10% → 50% → 100%

**Sample GitHub Actions workflow**

```yaml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: '3.11' }
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: make lint test
      - name: Build Docker
        run: docker build -t drl-api:ci -f Dockerfile .
```

# 11) Infra & Deployment

* **Containerize** everything; **Docker multi-stage** builds produce slim images.
* **Kubernetes** (managed: GKE/EKS/AKS). Use **Helm** charts (`deployment/k8s`) for:

  * `api` Deployment + HPA (CPU & custom latency SLO)
  * `executor` Deployment
  * MLflow Tracking + MinIO/S3 artifact store
  * Neo4j (or **Neo4j Aura** managed)
  * Prometheus/Grafana, **Evidently** service, Postgres
* **ArgoCD** watches `deployment/argo/*.yaml`.
* **Terraform** provisions cloud resources & secrets backends.

# 12) Monitoring & Observability

* **Infra**: Prometheus (latency, CPU/mem, pod restarts), Grafana dashboards.
* **Model**:

  * **Evidently**: drift on states, actions, realized returns vs training; data quality checks.
  * **Custom risk metrics** streaming from backtest/live: PnL, Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, VaR/ES, turnover, exposure by sector/liquidity bucket.
* **Alerting**: On drift > threshold, Sharpe rolling < floor, drawdown > limit, failed on-chain tx, order mismatch.

# 13) Security & Compliance

* **Secrets**: Vault/Secret Manager; never in env files.
* **Supply chain**: SBOM (Syft), image signing (Cosign), provenance (SLSA level 2+).
* **RBAC**: K8s/service accounts; **least privilege** to Postgres/Neo4j/MLflow.
* **PII**: none by design; market data licenses respected.
* **Audit**: log model version, hash, dataset hash to MLflow; **write hash to chain** on each deployment/rebalance.

# 14) KPIs to report (what hiring managers care about)

**Strategy KPIs**

* Annualized **Sharpe**, **Sortino**, **Calmar**
* **Max Drawdown**, **Average Drawdown Duration**
* **Hit rate**, **Turnover**, **Slippage**, **TCosts bps**
* **VaR/ES** at 95/99; **Beta** to market; **Sector/Factor exposures**
* **Profit stability** across regimes (subperiod Sharpe distribution)

**MLOps KPIs**

* **Deployment frequency** (models/week), **Lead time** to production
* **MTTR** for failed deploys, **Change failure rate**
* **Data freshness SLA**, **Drift incidents/month**, **Test coverage**

# 15) Backtesting & Paper Trading

* **Backtest engine** integrated in env; deterministic seeds; reproducible artifacts.
* **Walk-forward**: rolling retrain windows; time-blocked splits.
* **Paper trading**: market data feed → API weights → executor → on-chain event; reconcile against reference prices; publish daily markdown reports (auto-generated via Airflow) with plots + KPIs.

# 16) Day-0 to Day-30 Build Plan (aggressive, realistic)

* **Week 1**: Repo, Terraform baseline, MLflow/MinIO, Neo4j schema, ingestion + DVC, node2vec embeddings, basic env.
* **Week 2**: PPO baseline, Airflow DAG (ingest→features→train→validate), MLflow registry gates, FastAPI + Docker, CI smoke tests.
* **Week 3**: ArgoCD+K8s deploy, Prometheus/Grafana, Evidently drift, Hardhat contract + local devnet, executor microservice, end-to-end paper loop.
* **Week 4**: PBT tuning, stress tests, canary deploy, on-chain artifact hash, dashboards, write-ups & demo notebook.

# 17) Minimal Code/Config Stubs (copy-paste starters)

**Dockerfile (multi-stage)**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM base AS api
COPY services/api /app/services/api
CMD ["uvicorn", "services.api.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

**ArgoCD App (api) — `deployment/argo/api.yaml`**

```yaml

```

**Airflow DAG (skeleton)**

```python
with DAG("drl_pipeline", schedule="@daily", start_date=datetime(2024,1,1)) as dag:
    ingest >> build_graph >> gen_embeddings >> features >> train >> validate >> register >> deploy >> backtest >> report
```

**Graph embedding job (pseudo)**

```python
# graphs/embeddings/run_node2vec.py
g = neo4j_to_networkx()
emb = node2vec(g, dims=128, walk_len=80, num_walks=10)
write_parquet(emb, "graphs/embeddings/embedding.parquet")
```

If you want, I can generate:

* a **full GitHub Actions workflow** (train/validate/register/deploy),
* a **Neo4j Cypher ETL script** for correlations/sectors from CSV,
* or a **Solidity/Hardhat scaffold** with a working `rebalance()` test.

Great question! I can deliver this in a few practical formats—pick what fits your workflow:

1. **GitHub-ready mono-repo (recommended)**

* I’ll generate a **downloadable .zip** with the full scaffold: repo layout, Dockerfiles, FastAPI service, Airflow DAG skeleton, MLflow hooks, Neo4j schema/ETL, Hardhat contract + tests, Helm/ArgoCD manifests, GitHub Actions CI.
* You can unzip, `git init`, and push.

2. **Docs pack**

* **README.md** (systems overview + quickstart)
* **Runbook.pdf** (ops, SLAs, rollback)
* **Architecture diagram (SVG/PNG)**

3. **Notebooks bundle**

* E2E demo notebooks: data ingest → graph embeddings → RL training → backtest → drift report.

4. **IaC & Ops kit**

* **Terraform** module(s) for cloud infra, K8s, Neo4j (or Aura), MLflow/MinIO, Prom/Grafana.
* **OpenAPI spec** for the inference API.

5. **Neo4j + Data pack**

* Cypher schema, sample CSVs, node2vec job, example feature parquet, and validation checks.

If you say “go” with the **GitHub-ready mono-repo**, I’ll create the starter **.zip** here in chat so you can download it and start building immediately.
